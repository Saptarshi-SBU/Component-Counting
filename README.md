# Component-Counting
Component counting based on image processing techniques

The project explores several approaches for implementing object detection
starting with legacy based polygonal approximation techniques to machine
learning techniques.

polygon approximation : uses geometric algorithms like convex hull to estimate
the type of polygon. Some amount of image preprocessing like blurring, edge-detection
is required

machine learning : using modern deep learning techniques. This is work in progress.
